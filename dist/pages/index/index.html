I’m from Guangzhou, a city in Guangzhou province. But I want to stay in Tokyo to find a suitable job for myself. </p> <p>I worked as a Software Engineer in VIPSHOP, and I have about 6 year work experience. My major work was Web development based on Nodejs. I also did some other things like writing test cases, doing detailed designs and so on. I think I'm a good team player in project teams. </p> <p>I was good at maths and i was really into learning new things so it was an easy decision to major in Computer Science and Technology at South China University of Technology. I spent most of my time on study in college. I have acquired basic knowledge of my major and gained a good academic performance. I also have passed CET6 during my college years. Now I also learn IELTS during the spare time to improve my English skills. </p> <p>I am eager to get an opportunity to fully play my ability, my computer skills and English skills. I think this job is a good choice and I can be competent for this job!! That’s all, thank you. </p> </section> <section class="container with-title"> <h2 class=title>SNS</h2> <div> <a href=https://www.instagram.com/ihoosin/ ><button type=button class="btn is-error">Instagram</button></a> </div> </section> <footer class=footer> <p> <a href=https://hoos.in/ target=_blank>Written by hoosin, all right reserved.</a> <span>-</span> <a href=https://twitter.com/ihoosin target=_blank>@ihoosin</a> </p> </footer> <script type="text/javascript" src="../../js/index.min.js?c88cf52bbdc631ec3b14"></script></body> </html>
